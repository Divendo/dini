# What is dini? #
Using dini you can easily use INI files in your software.
It is a very easy-to-use library and does not require some kind of complicated installation process.
It does only consist of some code files you've to include in your project and you're good to go!
This is possible because dini does only use the STL, so no external libraries are needed.

# What is an INI file? #
An INI file is commonly used to store settings.
You often recognise INI files by their extension: .ini, but of course they don't necessarily have this extension.
An example of an INI file could be:
```
[main]
homepage="http://divendo-webs.com"
newtab="about:blank"

[user]
name="divendo1180@gmail.com"
pass="0d5bb0547eea3c58732148c37de534f1"
autologin=true
```

# Using dini in your project #
To use dini in your project is, as said, very simple.
Just download the latest version.
Then extract the contents of the archive to some place on your hard drive, you probably want this to be a directory inside the directory of your project.
Include _dini.h_ and you're good to go!
In case you're wondering how the library works: it isn't very hard, just read the comments in the headers.
